# Christmas Game 
 Try it! 
I've tried to create a game which has 3 levels. The main idea of the game is that you have to help Santa to save the Christmas.

LVL1:
In the first level, you have to destroy 3 airplanes using 3 penguins.  You must target the airplane wing. You destroy an airplane only if you hit it 3 times. But be careful! The penguins are not coming back if you miss the target.

LVL2:
Now that the planes are destroyed, a lot of presents are going to fall from the sky. You have to catch at least 30 to pass the level. But be careful! If you catch a green present, you lose.

LVL3:
The third level is unfinished, but the main idea is that you have to run and jump with Santa. 

This project helped me to improve my OOP skills along with the C++ programming language. I've tried to implement physics, animations and different user interactions.
